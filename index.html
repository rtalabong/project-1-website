        <h1>Overanalyzing my green card petition</h1>
        <p class="subhead">Millions of immigration documents are processed each year. Mine is one of them. <br> This is an attempt at understanding the dizzying process and its infamous wait times.</p>

            <p>By <a href="https://rambotalabong.com">Rambo Talabong</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>The immigration process is stressful. This is a rant I have had ever since I moved to the United States in the fall of 2023.</p>
        <p>Some people can wait for months, while many end up waiting for years, decades even.</p>
        <p>I recently joined immigration purgatory after I was petitioned by my husband through the form I-130, the aim being that I get a green card so I can stay in the US permanently.</p>
        <p>We submitted our petition in February 2024. We have been waiting for 5 months â€“ not nearly as long as many others who are waiting, but still long enough to make me wonder.</p>
        <p>As I am in this wait, I have been learning how to improve my storytelling with the help of data through Columbia's Lede Program. </p>
        <p>For my first project, I thought: What better way to put these skills to use than to expound on my complaint? And so I have this project, using data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p> 
        <p>First, I aimed to show the scale and the direction of the process. How many are we in this? How does it start and how does it end? For this, I made the chart below.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="full-width">
            <figure>
                <img
                    src="sankeyFinal.jpg">

            </figure>
        </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Next: Just like most of the people with an immigration petition, I am most preoccupied by the speed. How soon can I get my green card?</p>
        <p>With this in mind, I wanted to know how the immigration processing speed changed from one administration to another, starting with Obama's last term.</p>
        <p>With Biden possibly being replaced by Trump in the next presidential election, I wanted to know if it would affect my wait time. And if so, how much?</p>
        <p>The only way to do this was by comparing the immigration speeds of each administration. Fortunately, they were recorded every year.</p>
        <p>It appears to be that Trump slowed down the processing of most immigration documents following Obama. Biden ended up being slower, but he also inherited a backlog from Trump during the pandemic.</p>
    </div>

        <figure class="center-container charts">
            <img
                src="presidentsFinal.jpg">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>


    <div class="content">
        <p>Because I am prone to overthinking, I also wanted to find out one more thing: Does filing at a lucky time matter? Are there months when the USCIS processes documents faster?</p> 
        <p>If so, I wanted to know whether within Biden's time as president, there were notable fluctuations in processing time based on when one made their submission.</p>
        <p>Luckily, the USCIS published the quarterly processing times of immigration documents.</p>
        <p>For immigration documents in our category, processing time did not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. However, it is a different story for different immigration forms.</p>
    </div>

    <figure class="center-container charts">
        <img
            src="bidenQuarter.jpg">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="content">
        <p>This personal project by no means answers all immigration questions. It does not even answer all of mine.</p> 
        <p>If I had the data, I would have loved to find out the difference in denial rates among the three presidents I looked at. (Just because Trump was faster did not mean he approved more than he denied.)</p>
        <p>Immigration is also a multifaceted phenomenon. Immigration processing time is not the only metric to judge a president's immigration policy.</p>
        <p>For me at least, I know that fluctuations from president to president or quarter to quarter within Biden's term are not significant enough that I should be worried about waiting for years. </p>
